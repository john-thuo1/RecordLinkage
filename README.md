# RecordLinkage
Refers to the process of identifying and connecting records that correlate with the same entity or individual within one or across multiple data sources. The primary goal of record linkage is to eliminate or reduce duplication and inconsistency in datasets by linking related records together.

# Data Used
To demonstrate this implementation, Faker library was used to generate Synthetic Data: credit_data.csv and customer_data.csv.
Proceed and download the data to try out the implementation. Alternatively, you can use recordlinkage's provided datasets.
Check out the Library's [Documentation](https://recordlinkage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ref-datasets.html) on how to load this data.
